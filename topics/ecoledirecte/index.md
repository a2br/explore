Created by Statim and aquired by Aplim, EcoleDirecte is the portal of the Charlemagne french software suite, used by families, students, teachers and staff inside of schools to perform everyday actions specific to the school environment. Although the website or its API themselves aren't open-sourced, a third-party ecosystem built around these services is slowly appearing.
