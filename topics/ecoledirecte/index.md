Created by Statim (now Aplim) in 2002, EcoleDirecte is the portal of the Charlemagne french software suite, used by parents, students, teachers and staff to perform everyday actions specific to the school environment. Although the website or its API themselves are proprietary, a third-party ecosystem built around these services remains.
